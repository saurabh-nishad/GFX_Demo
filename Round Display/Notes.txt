Note: Different from the traditional SPI protocol, the data line from the slave to the master is hidden since the device only has display requirement.
RESX Is the reset pin, it should be low when powering the module and be higher at other times;;
CSX is slave chip select, when CS is low, the chip is enabled.
D/CX is data/command control pin, when DC = 0, write command, when DC = 1, write data
SDA is the data pin for transmitting RGB data, it works as the MOSI pin of SPI interface;
SCL worka s the SCLK pins of SPI interface.
SPI communication has data transfer timing, which is combined by CPHA and CPOL.
CPOL determines the level of the serial synchronous clock at idle state. When CPOL = 0, the level is Low. However, CPOL has little effect to the transmission.
CPHA determines whether data is collected at the first clock edge or at the second clock edge of serial synchronous clock; when CPHL = 0, data is collected at the first clock edge.
There are 4 SPI communication modes. SPI0 is commonly used, in which CPHL = 0, CPOL = 0.
